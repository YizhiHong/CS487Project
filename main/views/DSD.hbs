                    <p>This tool maintains a small repository of school books. It could track books, classes and
                        students who check out books. And staff shall manage books information and teacher shall check
                        out the book that they teach.</p>
                    <h4 id="chapter1-1">1.1 Goals and objectives</h4>
                    <p>This tool maintains a repository of school books. The main goals of this application is to build
                        a small repository of school books which support different kinds of operations for users.
                        The objective of this software development lies in how well the requirements are understood and
                        how this can be developed using proper planned phases in different modules. The application
                        shall track books, classes and students who check out books. Each book has a unique school
                        generated ID. A total number of books shall be tracked. The ability to add/update/delete all
                        information is required. Numeric key fields should be automatically generated. Such as book ID,
                        Student Id, Staff ID. Security is required.</p>
                    <p>All users must be granted access to the system before they can use it. Access must be based on
                        levels. The system must respond to all requests within 5 seconds. The application shall list
                        all students with books checked out showing due date and date checked out. List all users and
                        their access level. List all books in the system with search capabilities. To list all orders
                        by order type (PC Repair Orders, etc.). List of all books checked out by class or book
                        name/number. List of students and parents info with amount due. </p>
                    <p>What’s more, each Book is identified with an ISBN number and unique school generated number.
                        Each student shall check out up to the number of classes he/she is registered for. Each
                        staff/teacher is assigned a unique user ID and an ID. Books data needs to be stored in a
                        database of some sort and the data shall be obtained from an online web service
                        (google books, Amazon or any other source). Each class the school offer must be recorded in
                        the database.</p>

                    <h4 id="chapter1-2">1.2 Statement of scope</h4>
                    <p>The tool is mainly used in a school’s library. </p>
                    <p>It could track books, classes, students and teachers who check out books. </p>
                    <p>The essential goal is to track books by ISBN, to track students and teachers by ID. The desirable
                        goal is to count the number of books checked out, and those left in the library. The future goal
                        is to apply this tool into multiple platform in a different context, like hospital counting
                        medicine, police station counting guns, etc.</p>
                    <p>The Scope of the Project is to provide an interface to the customers that can interact with the
                        system on a web based form which generates the list of order or repairs etc. to the
                        administrator and also to the customer. This kind of format is very reasonable to manage and
                        maintain for both administrator and to the customer.</p>
                    <p>The List of major inputs, processing, etc. is presented below and their ranks are also specified.</p>
                    <p>The application shall be accessible through a web browser such as chrome, Firefox, Safari and so
                        on. It shall prompt the user for a username and password. Upon entering this information
                        correctly, the user shall have access to the repository of school books.</p>
                    <p>For the users, they shall be able to search and check out books which is essential for the
                        course. In additional, the users shall able to view the capabilities of books. Most importantly,
                        the user shall be able to view the current state of the orders.</p>
                    <p>The users shall do this by requesting a report from the system. The report shall display,
                        according to the type of report requested, either:
                    </p>
                    <p>1.All students with books checked out showing due date and date checked out.</p>
                    <p>2.All authorized users and their access level.</p>
                    <p>3.All books in the system with search capabilities.</p>
                    <p>4.All orders by order type.</p>
                    <p>5.All books checked out by class or book name/number.</p>
                    <p>In the case that a new book is offered by the store, the administrator shall have the capability
                        to add new items into the repository for tracking. To help maintain the current repository
                        state, the administrator shall have the ability to update the quantity of books in repository
                        when books are checked out. In order to update the information, the administrator will have to
                        enter the number of books checked out, the due date. The administrator shall also be able to
                        delete books in the case that they are no longer offered. Every book shall be differentiated by
                        an ISBN number. Similar codes shall be created for the purpose of identifying students and
                        teachers.</p>
                    <p>In the case that a student or a teacher contact information should change, the administrator
                        shall be able to update the contact information for the students or teachers. The administrator
                        shall also have the ability to delete information of students or teachers.The administrator
                        shall be able to add, update, and delete order information in the same way that he/she is able
                        to do for a customer's information. In additional, the administrator shall search all the access
                        level of authorized users and shall view all books checked out by class or book name/number.</p>
                    <p>The customer list shall be maintained in a similar way to the books. When a student or teacher
                        wants to check out some books, the system will list all the information of books through
                        searching by book’s name or ISBN number. When students or teachers check out some books, system
                        will automatically decrease the amount of books in the tracking portion of the system for
                        repository. Students shall able to view the due date and the date checked out of books they
                        checked out and check our up to the number of  classes he/she is registered for through
                        entering their ID.</p>
                    <p>Please see the table on the next page for more details on the system's requirements and
                        capabilities.</p>

                    <p>The software is used to check and order books in a high school efficiently. It is a web based
                        application which basically consists of 3 tier architecture. Application server (Node.js) will
                        mainly handle the web application.</p>
                    <p>The application will communicate to the database (MongoDB)
                        to communicate and retrieve information. Users shall use a browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari) to
                        access the application. With the growing number of the users, in order to keep track of the
                        changes to its books, the system shall not only allow multiple users to maintain an up-to-date
                        account of the book repository, it shall also help link its inventory to both the users who
                        borrow (check out) the book and the other users who return them. </p>
                    <p>The system will help control the management process of the repository by keeping current contact
                        information for students, parents, teachers and staffs. The students and the parents can be the
                        main users who can borrow (check out), return their books and update their information.
                        The teachers shall borrow (check out) more books than students and parents.
                        The staffs shall manage the book information or inventory. Also, they can control the whole system.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="chapter1-4">1.4 Major constraints</h4>
                    <p>The major constraints in the development are that the system should respond within the required
                        constraint described in the project manual. The software is developed keeping in mind about the
                        needs of the customer and their interaction between the system. </p>
                    <p>The software is designed to give the best efficiency possible. It is also organized to fix quick
                        errors or bugs.</p>

                    <h3 id="chapter2">2. Data Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        This part will describe the data structure including internal, global, and temporary data
                        structures.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="chapter2-1">2.1 Internal software data structure</h4>
                    <p>
                        High School Book Tracking web application’s internal structure is divided into two different
                        main parts: Server-side and Client-side. </p>
                    <p>For our Server-side, the data of the user information, book information and book inventory will
                        be stored in our local database. The functionality of the storage will be accomplished using a
                        MongoDB database. The data structure in the server will be handled in which defined based on the
                        classes in requirement document and later. </p>
                    <p>The Server side will be implemented by Node.js and Express back-end Framework. </p>
                    <p>The class will be isolated in model module, The businesses and functionality will be controlled
                        in Controller module, The view skeleton will be implemented in View module. Therefore, The data
                        flowing will be handled by way of MVC (Model-View-Controller) System.</p>
                    <p>The server side (Express) and the client-side (web browser) will exchange data in two ways: The First way
                        is back-end Controller will render needed data for View which is for initialization, The Second way is back-end
                        Controller sending data using JSON format which is for the huge amount of data.</p>
                    <p>The client side exchange data mainly using the JSON based RESTful. The JSON is a versatile data
                        object format which already dominated a web development. The client-side as web page mainly
                        manipulated by javascript, exchange by AJAX.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="chapter2-2">2.2 Global data structure</h4>
                    <p>The global data structure of book tracking web application is characterized by the MongoDB database.
                        The client-side (web browser) shall never access this database directly, it shall be able to
                        make requests to our server side and get the data safely. The architecture of the data structure
                        reveals the data is that the app need in its purest sense.</p>
                    <h4 id="chapter2-3">2.3 Temporary data structure</h4>
                    <p>The temporary data will be mainly exist in our client-side which is a web browser. There will be
                        two mainly data objects’ type in our web browser. The one is cookie saved in the user’s browser
                        to temporarily manipulate the user local data. The other is session saved on the machine to
                        temporarily manage the login state. Those Temporary data will help us to refine and improve our
                        application by lowering data exchange and front-end rely.</p>
                    <h4 id=class"2-4">2.4 Database description</h4>
                    <p>The Database will be preserved by MongoDB. The MongoDB as a document oriented database will have
                        a lot of different features compare with traditional relational database.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> The document oriented database can essentially provide a flexible JSON structure.
                        <li> The document oriented database don’t have to make a rigorous initialization.
                        <li> The document oriented database don’t have “relation” which means no more relational join
                            or limit. All relation from business oriented can be solved by ID and flexible structure.
                    </ol>
                    <p>It’s a very powerful database for web development based on Node.js.
                    Here is our ERD Diagram on requirement specification document.
                        So we can divide as 5 tables.</p>


                    <h3 id="chapter3">3. Architecture and component-level design</h3>
                    <h4 id="chapter3-1">3.1 System structure</h4>
                    <p>The High School Book Tracking web application is broken up into two main parts: A server-side Node.js with mongoDB
                        as database and the client-side(HTML,CSS,Javascript) in web browser.</p>
                    <h4 id="chapter3-2">3.2  Student class</h4>
                    <h5>3.2.1 Processing Narrative (PSPEC)</h5>
                    <p>When a Students user first creates his /her account in the website, a new Student object is created. This object
                        is responsible for storing information unique to the Student users. This object includes the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>StudentID
                        <li>CWID
                        <li>Email
                        <li>Password
                        <li>FirstName
                        <li>LastName
                        <li>Birthday
                        <li>AmountDue
                    </ul>
                    <p>Thus, when the information related to the Student users is required, the Student user object is called upon.</p>
