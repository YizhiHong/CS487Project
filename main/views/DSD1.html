        1. Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
        This tool maintains a small repository of school books. It could track books, classes and students who check
        out books. And staff shall manage books information and teacher shall check out the book that they teach.
    </p>

    <h3>
        1.1 Goals and objectives
    </h3>
    This tool maintains a repository of school books. The main goals of this application is to build a small repository
    of school books which support different kinds of operations for users. The objective of this software development
    lies in how well the requirements are understood and how this can be developed using proper planned phases in
    different modules. The application shall track books, classes and students who check out books. Each book has a
    unique school generated ID. A total number of books shall be tracked. The ability to add/update/delete all
    information is required. Numeric key fields should be automatically generated. Such as book ID, Student Id, Staff
    ID. Security is required.  All users must be granted access to the system before they can use it. Access must be
    based on levels. The system must respond to all requests within 5 seconds. The application shall list all students
    with books checked out showing due date and date checked out. List all users and their access level. List all books
    in the system with search capabilities. To list all orders by order type (PC Repair Orders, etc.). List of all books
    checked out by class or book name/number. List of students and parents info with amount due. What’s more, each Book
    is identified with an ISBN number and unique school generated number. Each student shall check out up to the number
    of classes he/she is registered for. Each staff/teacher is assigned a unique user ID and an ID. Books data needs to
    be stored in a database of some sort and the data shall be obtained from an online web service (google books, Amazon
    or any other source). Each class the school offer must be recorded in the database.

    <h3>
        1.2 Statement of scope
    </h3>
    The tool is mainly used in a school’s library. It could track books, classes, students and teachers who check out
    books. The essential goal is to track books by ISBN, to track students and teachers by ID. The desirable goal is to
    count the number of books checked out, and those left in the library. The future goal is to apply this tool into
    multiple platform in a different context, like hospital counting medicine, police station counting guns, etc. The
    Scope of the Project is to provide an interface to the customers that can interact with the system on a web based
    form which generates the list of order or repairs etc. to the administrator and also to the customer. This kind of
    format is very reasonable to manage and maintain for both administrator and to the customer. The List of major
    inputs, processing, etc. is presented below and their ranks are also specified. The application shall be accessible
    through a web browser such as chrome, Firefox, Safari and so on. It shall prompt the user for a username and
    password. Upon entering this information correctly, the user shall have access to the repository of school books.
    For the users, they shall be able to search and check out books which is essential for the course. In additional,
    the users shall able to view the capabilities of books. Most importantly, the user shall be able to view the current
    state of the orders. The users shall do this by requesting a report from the system. The report shall display,
    according to the type of report requested, either:

    <ol>
        <li>All students with books checked out showing due date and date checked out.
        <li>All authorized users and their access level.
        <li>All books in the system with search capabilities.
        <li>All books checked out by class or book name/number.
    </ol>

    In the case that a new book is offered by the store, the administrator shall have the capability to add new items
    into the repository for tracking. To help maintain the current repository state, the administrator (staff) shall
    have the ability to update the quantity of books in the repository. In order to update the information, the
    administrator will have to enter the number of books checked out, the due date. The administrator shall also be
    able to delete books in the case that they are no longer offered. Every book shall be differentiated by an ISBN
    number. Similar codes shall be created for the purpose of identifying students and teachers. In the case that a
    student or a teacher contact information should change, the administrator shall be able to update the contact
    information for the students or teachers. The administrator shall also have the ability to delete information of
    students or teachers.The administrator shall be able to add, update, and delete order information in the same way
    that he/she is able to do for a customer's information. In addition, the administrator shall search all the access
    level of authorized users and shall view all books checked out by class or book name/number. The customer list shall
    be maintained in a similar way to the book. When a student or teacher wants to check out some books, the system will
    list all the information of books through searching by book’s name or ISBN number. When students or teachers check
    out some books, the system will automatically decrease the amount of books in the tracking portion of the system for
    repository. Students shall able to view the due date and the date checked out of books they checked out and check
    our up to the number of  classes he/she is registered for through entering their ID. Please see the table on the
    next page for more details on the system's requirements and capabilities.



    <h3>
        1.3 Software context
    </h3>
    The software is used to check and order books in a high school efficiently. It is a web based application which
    basically consists of 3 tier architecture. Application server (Node.js) will mainly handle the web application. The
    application will communicate to the database (MongoDB) to communicate and retrieve information. Users shall use a
    browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari) to access the application. With the growing number of the users, in order to keep
    track of the changes to its books, the system shall not only allow multiple users to maintain an up-to-date account
    of the book repository, it shall also help link its inventory to both the users who borrow (check out) the book and
    the other users who return them. The system will help control the management process of the repository by keeping
    current contact information for students, parents, teachers and staffs. The students and the parents can be the main
    users who can borrow (check out), return their books and update their information. The teachers shall borrow (check
    out) more books than students and parents. The staffs shall manage the book information or inventory. Also, they can
    control the whole system.

    <h3>
        1.4 Major constraints
    </h3>
    The software needs to use the API from the third party like google books, or Amazon books. This would restrict its
    originality. Also, It would be run in the certain web browser, it requests network and initial data for student,
    staff and teacher.


    <h2>
        2.Data design
    </h2>
    This part will describe the data structure including internal, global, and temporary data structures.
    <h3>
        2.1 Internal software data structure
    </h3>
    High School Book Tracking web application’s internal structure is divided into two different main parts: Server-side
    and Client-side. For our Server-side, the data of the user information, book information and book inventory will be
    stored in our local database. The functionality of the storage will be accomplished using a MongoDB database. The
    data structure in the server will be handled in which defined based on the classes in requirement document and
    later. The Server side will be implemented by Node.js and Express back-end Framework. The class will be isolated in
    model module, The businesses and functionality will be controlled in Controller module, The view skeleton will be
    implemented in View module. Therefore, The data flowing will be handled by way of MVC (Model-View-Controller)
    System. The server side (Express) and the client-side (web browser) will exchange data in two ways: The First way
    is back-end Controller will render needed data for View which is for initialization, The Second way is back-end
    Controller sending data using JSON format which is for the huge amount of data. The client side exchange data
    mainly using the JSON based RESTful. The JSON is a versatile data object format which already dominated a web
    development. The client-side as web page mainly manipulated by javascript, exchange by AJAX.
    <h3>
        2.2 Global data structure
    </h3>
    The global data structure of book tracking web application is characterized by the MongoDB database. The client-side
    (web browser) shall never access this database directly, it shall be able to make requests to our server side and
    get the data safely. The architecture of the data structure reveals the data is that the app need in its purest
    sense.
    <h3>
        2.3 Temporary data structure
    </h3>
    The temporary data will be mainly exist in our client-side which is a web browser. There will be two mainly data
    objects’ type in our web browser. The one is cookie saved in the user’s browser to temporarily manipulate the user
    local data. The other is session saved on the machine to temporarily manage the login state. Those Temporary data
    will help us to refine and improve our application by lowering data exchange and front-end rely.
    <h3>
        2.4 Database description
    </h3>
    The Database will be preserved by MongoDB. The MongoDB as a document oriented database will have a lot of different
    features compare with traditional relational database.
    <ol>
        <li> The document oriented database can essentially provide a flexible JSON structure.
        <li> The document oriented database don’t have to make a rigorous initialization.
        <li> The document oriented database don’t have “relation” which means no more relational join or limit. All
        relation from business oriented can be solved by ID and flexible structure.
    </ol>
    It’s a very powerful database for web development based on Node.js.
    Here is our ERD Diagram on requirement specification document.
    So we can divide as 5 tables.

    Department





    Staff

    Student

    Course

    <h2>
        4.2 Interface design rules
    </h2>
    The interfaces of this web application called “Book tracking system” are based on the Ben Shneiderman’s “Eight
    Golden Rules of Interface Design”. The details of eight rules are shown as below:
    <h3>
        4.2.1 Strive for consistency.
    </h3>
    Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations; identical terminology should be used in
    prompts, menus, and help screens; and consistent commands should be employed throughout.
    In this web application, all contents are arranged in left side or in the central of the webpage.
    <h3>
        4.2.2 Enable frequent users to use shortcuts.
    </h3>
    As the frequency of use increases, so do the user's desires to reduce the number of interactions and to increase
    the pace of interaction. Abbreviations, function keys, hidden commands, and macro facilities are very helpful to
    an expert user. In this web application, buttons are used for making user finish the task quickly.
    <h3>
        4.2.3 Offer informative feedback.
    </h3>
    For every operator action, there should be some system feedback. For frequent and minor actions, the response can
    be modest, while for infrequent and major actions, the response should be more substantial. This web application
    will give feedbacks when the user finish the operation. When some errors happen, the user will receive the message.
    <h3>
        4.2.4 Design dialog to yield closure.
    </h3>
    Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end. The informative feedback
    at the completion of a group of actions gives the operators the satisfaction of accomplishment, a sense of relief,
    the signal to drop contingency plans and options from their minds, and an indication that the way is clear to
    prepare for the next group of actions.
    <h3>
        4.2.5 Offer simple error handling.
    </h3>
    As much as possible, design the system so the user cannot make a serious error. If an error is made, the system
    should be able to detect the error and offer simple, comprehensible mechanisms for handling the error.
    If user do not input the available information, the note will show the user why the information is unavailable.
    <h3>
        4.2.6 Permit easy reversal of actions.
    </h3>
    This feature relieves anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone; it thus encourages exploration of
    unfamiliar options. The units of reversibility may be a single action, a data entry, or a complete group of actions.
    The staff users have the highest authority which can help the teachers and students  modify some operation errors.
    <h3>
        4.2.7 Support internal locus of control.
    </h3>
    Experienced operators strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the system and that the system responds
    to their actions. Design the system to make users the initiators of actions rather than the responders.
    As highest manager, staff users will control the system if it is necessary.
    <h3>
        4.2.8 Reduce short-term memory load.
    </h3>
    The limitation of human information processing in short-term memory requires that displays be kept simple, multiple
    page displays be consolidated, window-motion frequency be reduced, and sufficient training time be allotted for
    codes, mnemonics, and sequences of actions.
    Each menu is designed for a single task which make every operation is easy understood by the user.

    <h2>
        4.3 Components available
    </h2>
    The Bootstrap provides plenty of GUI components. The web application will use many of them including the following:
    <h3>
        4.3.1 Tables
    </h3>
    Tables are using for showing some information on the webpage, such as book information and user information.
    <h3>
        4.3.2 Input groups:
    </h3>
    Extend form controls by adding text or buttons before, after, or on both sides of any text-based <input>.
    <h3>
        4.3.3 Button
    </h3>
    This web application will use buttons as events driven. Each menu will have its own button to interact with users.
    <h3>
        4.3.4 TextView
    </h3>
    The TextView components allow webpage show text in a linear way.
    <h3>
        4.4 UIDS description
    </h3>
    The user interface development system is provided by bootstraps.
    Our UIDS uses many components from bootstraps. But the graphical components in bootstraps is not enough, so much of
    the components were designed by ourselves modifying the html codes.
    Every function in the menu will be implemented by using Javascript.






    <h2>
        5. Restrictions, limitations, and constraints
    </h2>

    <h3>
        5.1 Restrictions
    </h3>
    This is a local environmental program since no online web server.
    It is for one high school only.
    All the users’ information stored in a database which is accessible from faculty (teacher and staff).
    Teachers shall only borrow (check out) the books needed for the class.
    Students shall only borrow (check out) the book equal or less to the number of classes registered.

    <h3>
        5.2 Limitations
    </h3>
    The system should respond within required constraint in the project manual specifications.
    The system should be used in the interaction between students, parents,  teachers, staff and the database.
    The system should provide the best result possible.
    The mongodb needs more memory than relational databases.
    Node.js as a web server has some disadvantage. Being a single-threaded platform focused on I/O bound applications
    on top of a language that does not guarantee purity and has no support for co-routines.

    <h3>
        5.3 Constraint
    </h3>

    The student and teacher can’t not register a class for a client site. It should be on the database before the
    final version.
    The users must have their correct usernames(Email) and passwords to enter into the user center.
    The course and the due time of the book should only maintain by the developer.


    <h2>
        6. Testing Issues
    </h2>
    Test strategy and preliminary test case specification are presented in this section.
    <h3>
        6.1 Classes of tests
    </h3>
    <h4>
        6.1.1 White box testing
    </h4>
    The developer shall assign to the class to make sure each function is working when the class is being implemented.

    testing for the code and prevent the bug from over version release.
    <h4>
        6.1.2 Black box testing
    </h4>
    The Black box Testing will comprise a majority of the application process. The Testing will be needed after all the
    components are successfully implemented. It will be not consider about the architecture and inner structure of our
    book tracking web application, And it will consist of running through all functionality and different situation.
    <h4>
        6.1.3 Other testings

    Algorithm
    Create students, teachers, Staff, lists and make sure all data is accurate.


    Performance
    Time all actions to make sure web browser runs smoothly.



    <h3>
        6.3 Performance bounds
    </h3>
    According to the requirement of our web application. The interactions between the client web browser and the
    server shall take the time within 5 seconds. And Since the deployment will be running our server locally, The
    user from other networking can’t be able to access our system. We only allow one high school to use our web
    application. We don't allow the user over thousand since the database and the server will not be able to handle
    the huge amount user’s data. What we focus is on how to organize the book and students and make the book tracking
    system. We might not allow people to register as a new staff since the level restriction. Our product can’t not be
    deployed to the marketplace since the limited functionality and server size.

    <h3>
        6.4 Identification of critical components
    </h3>
    The two most critical components of the book tracking application - Server-side and Client-side.

    For our Server-side, Without proper setup and interaction with database. Our website will be rendered useless
    information or crush. The testing must be done and ensure the validation of the server. And the information
    before writing in the database must be verified.

    For our Client-side, We have to ensure the data sending to the server shall be verified by Client-side Script
    before entering the server. The view of Client-side shall clearly show the consistency of information provided
    by the server.
